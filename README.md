# Solving_Problems

A collection of the code created as I work through the book "Learn to Code by Solving Problems" by Daniel Zingaro.

This book is written around a curated sequence of programming competition challenges for Python3.

Except where otherwise noted, problem codes can be searched for on https://dmoj.ca to find the relevant problem prompts.
